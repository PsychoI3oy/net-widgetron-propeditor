 * Pressing back will return to the Main screen, abandoning changes.

 * Tapping  save saves the file under its current name, saveas opens the filename input to save (but 'save' after this will save as the original filename)
  there is no name checking on the save (so you can saveas build.prop.bak).

=Merge:=
With an existing build.prop open, you can 'merge' another build.prop file to overwrite/add the settings in it. This should make it easy for users with a list of common changes to modify their build.prop
after flashing a new CM (or other) update.

Example:

have /sdcard/mergeme.prop with
{{{
ro.product.model=T-Mobile G1
}}}
to make T-Mobile apps work (cm5 default for model being HTC Dream) 

open PropEditor

open /system/build.prop

menu->merge, pick /sdcard/mergeme.prop

*visually verify it worked, this is still experimental*

menu->save


=Example 2: =
To make facebook sync work on CM5/G1: 

open PropEditor

open /system/build.trout.prop

tap ro.product.name, tap 'opal'

tap ro.product.device, tap 'sapphire'

hit menu, tap save

reboot.
