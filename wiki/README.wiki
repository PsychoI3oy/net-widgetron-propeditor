  * Tapping 'Open File' button opens a (text box) file dialog, (defaulting to /sdcard/propeditor); enter the name of a build.prop type file on the sdcard. (editing directly on /system/ is not supported yet )
  * Opening anything other than a readable **.prop file (based on extension only) will result in an error.
  * New in 0.2: Copy /system/**.prop to /sdcard/propeditor: does what it says on the tin
  * New in 0.2: Copy /sdcard/propeditor/**.prop to /system: remounts system rw, copies **.prop into /system, remounts system ro. 


=Editor screen:=

 * Pressing back will return to the Main screen, abandoning changes.

 * Tapping  save saves the file under its current name, saveas opens the filename input to save (but 'save' after this will save as the original filename)
  there is no name checking on the save (so you can saveas build.prop.bak).

=Suggestion list:=
  * Pressing the back button will return to the Editor screen;

  * Tapping a suggested VALUE will change the selected entry and return to the Editor screen; Selecting "Manual entry" will pop up a manual entry dialog. 

  * Tapping  a suggested NAME (from Add in editor) will suggest values per above for the new property.

=Merge:=
With an existing build.prop open, you can 'merge' another build.prop file to overwrite/add the settings in it. This should make it easy for users with a list of common changes to modify their build.prop
after flashing a new CM (or other) update.

Example:

have /sdcard/mergeme.prop with
{{{
ro.product.model=T-Mobile G1
}}}
to make T-Mobile apps work (cm5 default for model being HTC Dream) 

open PropEditor

tap "copy /system/**.prop to /sdcard/propeditor/"

open /sdcard/propeditor/build.prop

menu->merge, pick /sdcard/mergeme.prop

menu->save

*visually verify it worked, this is still experimental*

tap "copy /sdcard/propeditor/**.prop to /system/"


=Example 2: =
To make facebook sync work on CM5/G1: 

In terminal emulator (or connectbot or adb shell or whatever)

su

open PropEditor

tap "copy /system/**.prop to /sdcard/propeditor/"

open /sdcard/propeditor/build.trout.prop

tap ro.product.name, tap 'opal'

tap ro.product.device, tap 'sapphire'

hit menu, tap save

press back

tap "copy /sdcard/propeditor/**.prop to /system/"

reboot.
